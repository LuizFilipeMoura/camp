## Select

`Select` is used to search a list with a given value and display selected records set.

```jsx live
<div style={{ height: "400px" }}>
  <Select
    name="basicSelect"
    searchRecords={[
      { itemId: "1", text: "Taylor K", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "2", text: "Tim T", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "3", text: "Carla P", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "4", text: "Carla B", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "5", text: "Lean C", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "6", text: "Lukasz W", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "7", text: "Zach W", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "8", text: "Jimena N", type: "item" },
      { itemId: "9", text: "Tom C", type: "item" },
    ]}
  />
</div>
```

### Size

This prop decides on the size of the select. The default and the only possible value is `default`.

```
  size?: "default"
```

### Invalid

The `invalid` is a boolean prop that changes select appearance between regular and invalid. The default value is `false`.

```
  invalid?: boolean
```

### Disabled

This boolean prop changes select appearance between regular and disabled. When true, typing within components is not possible and clicking has no effect. The default value is `false`.

```
  disabled?: boolean
```

### Name

The `name` is a required string prop. If `Select` is a part of a form, when the form is submitted, all chip ids can be found under a key equal to the `name`.

```
  name: string;
```

### Placeholder

`Placeholder` is a string shown within select component when no chips are within it and the input field is empty. The default value is `undefined`.

```
  placeholder?: string;
```

### SearchRecords

The `searchRecords` prop holds information about all records that can be chosen and added to the input area as chips. `searchRecords` is an array of objects that can be added as items to the `ListMenu` component. For more information, see `ListMenu` docs.

```
  searchRecords?: ListMenuProps["items"];
```

Example:

```
[
  { type: "header", text: "Lead" },
  { itemId: "1", text: "Taylor K", type: "item" },
  { type: "divider" },
  { type: "header", text: "Engineers" },
  { itemId: "2", text: "Tim T", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "3", text: "Carla P", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "4", text: "Carla B", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "5", text: "Lean C", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "6", text: "Lukasz W", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "7", text: "Zach W", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "8", text: "Jimena N", type: "item" },
  { itemId: "9", text: "Tom C", type: "item" },
]
```

### OnInputChange

This prop is a callback that is fired every time the input field value changes. One of the reasons to use it is when you want to dynamically change `searchRecords` based on the input value.

```
  onInputChange?: (value: string) => void;
```

### onChangeSelectedRecords

This prop is a callback that is updated any time the selected records within the Select component are changed. This gives the developer access to the actual data being selected by the user in the select field.

```
  onChangeSelectedRecords?: (records: SelectedRecord[]) => void;
```

### ShouldFilterRecords

The `shouldFilterRecords` is a boolean prop that decides if the records shown within the ListMenu will be filtered based on the input field value. The default value is `true`. You probably want to set it to `false` if the set of records to filter is not fixed, but instead is being fetched dynamically on input field value change.

```
  shouldFilterRecords?: boolean
```

### RecordsHeight

Using this prop, you can set height of the ListMenu component displaying the records. The default value is `initial`.

```
  recordsHeight?: string;
```

### ChipAppearance

The `chipAppearance` is a prop that decides on the appearance of the chips within the select component. If not set, chips will use their default props. To check the possible values of Chip's type and emphasis, please see the Chip documentation.

```
  chipAppearance?: ChipProps["type"] & ChipProps["emphasis"];
```

Example:

```
chipAppearance: {
  type: "outline"
  emphasis: "primary"
}
```

### InitialValue

InitialValue prop allows you to pass in an array of SelectedRecord[] that will populate into the select field on render.
